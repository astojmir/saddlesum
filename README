Standalone SaddleSum
====================


Summary

Robust and accurate data enrichment statistics via distribution function of sum
of weights

Term enrichment analysis facilitates biological interpretation by assigning to
experimentally/computationally obtained data annotation associated with terms
from controlled vocabularies. This process usually involves obtaining
statistical significance for each vocabulary term and using the most significant
terms to describe a given set of biological entities, often associated with
weights. Many existing enrichment methods require selections of (arbitrary
number of) the most significant entities and/or do not account for weights of
entities. Others either mandate extensive simulations to obtain statistics or
make assumptions about data distribution that need not be justifiable. In
addition, most methods have difficulty assigning correct statistical
significance to terms with few entities.

Implementing the well-known Lugananni-Rice formula, we have developed a novel
approach, called SaddleSum, that is free from all these undesirable
constraints. It approximates the distribution of sum of weights asymptotically
by saddlepoint method to arrive at analytically and computationally tractable
form.

We evaluated SaddleSum against several existing methods and demonstrated its
ability to adapt equally well to distributions with widely different
properties. With entity weights properly taken into account, SaddleSum is
internally consistent and stable with respect to the choice of number of most
significant entities selected. Making few assumptions on the input data, the
proposed method is universal and can thus be applied to areas beyond analysis of
microarrays, such as deep sequencing, quantitative proteomics and in silico
network simulations. SaddleSum also provides a term-size dependent score
distribution function that gives rise to accurate statistical significance even
for terms with few entities. As a consequence, SaddleSum enables researchers to
place confidence in its significance assignments to small terms that are often
biologically most specific.


SaddleSum software
------------------

**SaddleSum** is available in two versions, web and standalone. The web version is
mostly written in Python programming language and is a part of **qmbpmn-tools**
package, which also includes **ITM Probe**, a framework for analysis of information
flow in interaction networks based on random walks. The **qmbpmn-tools** package
depends on a number of external Python libraries and on the Graphviz suite for
visualizing graphs. The source code for **qmbpmn-tools** will be made available
in the future.

The standalone version is written completely in the C programming language and has
no dependencies beyond the gcc compiler and GNU make (although it is likely that
it can be adapted to compile using other development tools). It provides a
command line interface and uses term databases in a simple tab-delimited format
(GMT), as well as in SaddleSum's own ETD (Extended Term Database) format.

The same C code is used by both the web and the standalone version to compute
the enrichment P-values using Lugananni-Rice formula.

Building and installing executables
-----------------------------------

The source code for the standalone **SaddleSum** is available from the NCBI FTP site
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/qmbpmn/SaddleSum/src) as a tar.gz archive. Releases
of **SaddleSum** share the version numbering with the corresponding
**qmbpmn-tools**.

After downloading a source code, extract it to a chosen directory and enter the
``saddlesum-<version>`` directory. The standard process of::

  ./configure
  make
  make install

should install the binaries into your executable directory. To clean the build,
type ``make clean``. This requires gcc and GNU make.

We have successfully built the source on Linux systems, Mac OS X with gcc and on
Windows XP using MinGW. It may be possible to build it on other platforms but we
have not attempted to do so.

Obtaining Term Datasets
-----------------------

Term datasets corresponding to the three Gene Ontology (GO) categories
and KEGG pathways are available for a number of species in both ETD and GMT
format (gzipped). ETD datasets are recommended but GMT versions of the
same data is provided for compatibility with the earlier version. The
FTP link is ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/qmbpmn/SaddleSum/term_datasets . The
most recently built datasets are available under in the *current* subdirectory.

The naming of the GMT files follows the convention::

  <database>-<species>.gmt.gz

The <database> field is either ``GO-<category>`` or ``KEGG``, where ``category``
is one of ``mf`` (molecular function), ``bp`` (biological process) or ``cc``
(cellular component). The species field uses KEGG three-letter convention. The
currently available species are:

========== =========================
KEGG code  Species
========== =========================
ath        Arabidopsis thaliana
cel        Caenorhabditis elegans
dre        Danio rerio
dme        Drosophila melanogaster
hsa        Homo sapiens
mmu        Mus musculus
pfa        Plasmodium falciparum
rno        Rattus norvegicus
sce        Saccharomyces cerevisiae
========== =========================

For example ``GO-bp-pfa.gmt.gz`` contains the GO biological process database for
*Plasmodium falciparum*.

Each ETD file contains all provided term datasets for a single species
(the three GO namespaces plus KEGG). The naming of the ETD files
follows the convention::

  <species>.etd.gz

The species field again uses the KEGG three letter codes shown above.

Using SaddleSum
---------------

Standalone **SaddleSum** has a simple command line interface::

    saddlesum [options] <weights_file> [<namespace>:]<term_db> [<namespace>:<term_db> ...]

For full list of options, type::

    saddlesum -h

or see the :ref:`command-line-label` page in this manual.

The ``<weights_file>`` argument can either be a filename path or ``-``, which
means that the weights are to be taken from the command line. The weights are
supplied in the two-column tab-delimited format, where the first column gives
entity (gene) IDs, while the second gives their weights as floating point
numbers. No comment lines or multiple columns are allowed.

Entity IDs depend on the term database being searched. Each ETD database
contains, in addition to the term datasets, an abbreviated version of
the NCBI Gene database for its species. Thus, when using an ETD
database, SaddleSum is able to interpret entity IDs provided as Gene
IDs, as gene symbols and as gene aliases. If provided symbol is
ambiguous, SaddleSum reports a warning or an error, depending on
whether the ambiguity can be resolved.

The GMT term databases supplied on our FTP site use NCBI Gene IDs to
label genes and hence the weights supplied to ``saddlesum`` program
must also use NCBI Gene IDs to supply weights. We have decided on
using NCBI Gene IDs for this purpose because many genes have several
widely-used names, while GMT format does not allow specifying aliases.

The database arguments are in the format ``<namespace>:<term_db>``
where ``<namespace>`` is an arbitrary namespace label and
``<term_db>`` is the path to the term database. The first database can
be specified without the ``<namespace>`` label, which indicates that
the ``<term_db>`` is an ETD file. If ``<namespace>`` is present, a GMT
dataset is assumed. All subsequent arguments must specify the
namespace part and the term datasets must be in GMT format. In this
way, it is possible to combine an ETD database with several GMT
ones. The recommended use for GMT databases is to create customized
databases containing associations that cannot be found in GO or KEGG.

Namespace labels for GMT databases can be repeated. Significant terms
under the same namespace are sorted and printed together, with each
results table headed by the ``<namespace>`` label. Term datasets
within an ETD database already contain their namespace labels, which
can be inspected using the :ref:`saddlesum-show-etd-label` utility.


Examples
--------

The ``examples/`` subdirectory contains several examples of weights
from microarrays (log2 ratios) and term databases. All the examples
were taken from the NCBI GEO database and have the extension
``.tab``. The database files are in GMT format and have extension
``.gmt``. Copy ``saddlesum`` executable to your path and try the
following examples::

    saddlesum GDS3184_GSM253560_up_geneid.tab test:GO-bp-rno.gmt
    saddlesum GDS3184_GSM253560_down_geneid.tab test:GO-bp-rno.gmt

    saddlesum GDS2338_GSM102668_up_geneid.tab test:KEGG-sce.gmt
    saddlesum GDS2338_GSM102668_down_geneid.tab test:KEGG-sce.gmt

    saddlesum GDS2352_GSM89756_up_geneid.tab test:GO-cc-hsa.gmt
    saddlesum GDS2352_GSM89756_down_geneid.tab test:GO-cc-hsa.gmt

One can also experiment with options, such as setting the cutoffs and
similar. Note that the down-regulated weights were obtained by flipping the sign
on the original log2 ratios and setting all weights smaller than zero to zero
(please see our paper for explanation).
